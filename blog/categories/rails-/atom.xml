    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>OK, yeah, the title of this entry is one of the most common and repeated
sentences about Rails (and MVC in general) development. But there is
something else: <strong>it's a big, big, truth</strong>.</p>

<p>Being myself quite an eccentric developer, a lot of times I
started in a language without caring about this kind of advises. OK, I
follow most of the typical patterns -trying to maintain a scalable,
blablabla code- but nothing very specific, certainly nothing that cares
particularly about MVC.</p>

<p>So when I started to develop my first Rails project, <a href="http://www.fundidoanegro.net">Fundido a Negro</a>
, I gave a shit about maintaining
small controllers and did as most Rails beginners do: creating
grotesquely giant controllers. After some months, that made the code
almost impossible to understand, and even if I could have continued with
it, it was boring and confusing. So I stopped the project in a "more or
less OK" phase and started with something else.</p>

<p>After some months and experiences, I naturally understood what every
Rails guru (and most of developers) say: a big controller is a terrible
pain in the ass. But why a big model is (much) better than a big
controller? I don't really know the correct reason; I only can adventure
a few hypothesis that, I think, tell a lot about MVC.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>What the fuck is a controller?</strong>. Of the three elements in the
MVC, we can easily identify the first one with "real" objects (as in
object-oriented); the views are, like in the famous tale, the only part
of the real world (more like the data world) that users can see; they
care about the relationship between the user and the models. So far,
it's OK. But what are controllers? Only the middlemen, the border
policemen between the world of the data/objects/models and the view
country where users live.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Code in the model is easier to reuse and harder to duplicate</strong>. Imagine
that in a given action, you need the first n objects which its relation
x applies to a certain condition. If you write that method in the model you
can reuse it any other time, or even define it as a scope and
save you an awful lot of code. Giving access to every action of every controller to
that method will save you from the dangers of duplication, and also will
make you more conscious of the tools you already have created, as the
models tends to be in the center.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A big model is good for your imagination</strong>. When you have available
methods that deal with the data in your application in multiple
different ways, it's easier for you to think about new features.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Right now, I already feel like I'm repeating the obvious, but
I will show you another example. Those two pieces of code to the same:</p>

<p>Big controller style:</p>

<pre><code>def index_by_trending
  @premieretweets = Movie.with_tweet.inject([]) do |res,movie|
    res &lt;&lt; movie.tweets.by_score[0]
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Small controller style:</p>

<pre><code>def index_by_trending
  @premieretweets = Tweet.index_trending
end

(In the model)
def self.index_trending
  tweets = Movie.with_tweet.inject([]) do |res,movie|
    res &lt;&lt; movie.tweets.by_score[0]
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>OK. Now let's imagine we create another action in the same controller,
one that needs only the first 5 elements:</p>

<p>Big controller style:</p>

<pre><code>def short_index_by_trending
  @premieretweets = Movie.with_tweet[0..5].inject([]) do |res,movie|
    res &lt;&lt; movie.tweets.by_score[0]
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Small controller style:</p>

<pre><code>def short_index_by_trending
  @premieretweets = Tweet.index_trending[0..5]
end
</code></pre>

<p>In the end, you are reusing and not repeating code with the "small
controller style" solution and well, it also looks much tidier.</p>

<p>Those are some of the reasons why I really appreciate initiatives like
inherit_resources, even if I don't really use it so often (shame on me).</p>
