    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Talking with other developers, sometimes I notice that they use the
terms TDD and BDD. That was specially strange for me in the RuPy 2011,
when I was still not very sure of the difference between those two
software development techniques, and (at least for me) everyone used
them indifferently.</p>

<p>But they are not the same. In fact, BDD is an evolution, or an
extension, of TDD. Let&#8217;s try to define and point out the difference
between them.</p>

<h2>TDD (Test-Driven Development)</h2>

<blockquote><p>All code is guilty until proven innocent.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the university, we are taught that the main phases of the software are specification, design,
 implementation and testing, in this order. In TDD, testing comes before implementation;
 and thanks to its tools, it can be used as a kind of specification.</p>

<p>In a TDD process, we develop first the test and then we pass to the real
 code until the test accepts it. In an advanced project, when we implement
 a change into the code, we run all the tests, and not only the new one:
 like this we can detect quickly if a new piece of code it’s provoking
 errors in old features.</p>

<p><em>The TDD process:</em>

<h2>BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)</h2>

<p>BDD is a business-like, natural language, user-approach to TDD. In it,
we first define an acceptance test: we execute it and, obviously, it fails.
Then we define a unit test: it fails too. Then, and only then, we can
start with the code itself. When the given unit test passes, we execute
again the acceptance test, and if it fails, we start the process all
over again with a new unit test.</p>

<p>Using Ruby speech, we could say that <strong>BDD wraps an acceptance test
around a group of unit tests.</strong></p>

<p><em>The BDD process:</em>
<img class="center" src="images/atdd.jpg" title="TDD" alt="A diagram of TDD"></p>

<p>In BDD we also try to make tests particularly readable, using tools like
Rspec and Cucumber.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Even if it&#8217;s an expansion, and a good one, BDD is not &#8220;better&#8221; than TDD.
It&#8217;s just different. In some cases, using BDD just doesn&#8217;t have sense.
For example, in a gem or a plugin, to test the behavior of the user is
just impossible.</p>

<p>Actually, developers naturally understand that: they just are confused
by the similar names of B(bi)DD and T(ti)DD. You don&#8217;t code a gem using
BDD, even if it sounds cool: it&#8217;s TDD.</p>

<p>PS: Another day we should talk if BDD and TDD are so useful or if it&#8217;s
only a hype.</p>

    <link href="http://Gawyn.github.com/blog/blog/2012/02/01/big-models/"/>
    <updated>2012-02-01T11:04:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://Gawyn.github.com/blog/blog/2012/02/01/big-models</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>OK, yeah, the title of this entry is one of the most common and repeated
sentences about Rails (and MVC in general) development. But there is
something else: <strong>it&#8217;s a big, big, truth</strong>.</p>

<p>Being myself quite an eccentric developer, a lot of times I
started in a language without caring about this kind of advises. OK, I
follow most of the typical patterns -trying to maintain a scalable,
blablabla code- but nothing very specific, certainly nothing that cares
particularly about MVC.</p>

<p>So when I started to develop my first Rails project, <a href="http://www.fundidoanegro.net">Fundido a Negro</a>
, I gave a shit about maintaining
small controllers and did as most Rails beginners do: creating
grotesquely giant controllers. After some months, that made the code
almost impossible to understand, and even if I could have continued with
it, it was boring and confusing. So I stopped the project in a &#8220;more or
less OK&#8221; phase and started with something else.</p>

<p>After some months and experiences, I naturally understood what every
Rails guru (and most of developers) say: a big controller is a terrible
pain in the ass. But why a big model is (much) better than a big
controller? I don&#8217;t really know the correct reason; I only can adventure
a few hypothesis that, I think, tell a lot about MVC.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>What the fuck is a controller?</strong>. Of the three elements in the
MVC, we can easily identify the first one with &#8220;real&#8221; objects (as in
object-oriented); the views are, like in the famous tale, the only part
of the real world (more like the data world) that users can see; they
care about the relationship between the user and the models. So far,
it&#8217;s OK. But what are controllers? Only the middlemen, the border
policemen between the world of the data/objects/models and the view
country where users live.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Code in the model is easier to reuse and harder to duplicate</strong>. Imagine
that in a given action, you need the first n objects which its relation
x applies to a certain condition. If you write that method in the model you
can reuse it any other time, or even define it as a scope and
save you an awful lot of code. Giving access to every action of every controller to
that method will save you from the dangers of duplication, and also will
make you more conscious of the tools you already have created, as the
models tends to be in the center.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A big model is good for your imagination</strong>. When you have available
methods that deal with the data in your application in multiple
different ways, it&#8217;s easier for you to think about new features.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Right now, I already feel like I&#8217;m repeating the obvious, but
I will show you another example. Those two pieces of code to the same:</p>

<p>Big controller style:</p>

<pre><code>def index_by_trending
  @premieretweets = Movie.with_tweet.inject([]) do |res,movie|
    res &lt;&lt; movie.tweets.by_score[0]
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Small controller style:</p>

<pre><code>def index_by_trending
  @premieretweets = Tweet.index_trending
end

(In the model)
def self.index_trending
  tweets = Movie.with_tweet.inject([]) do |res,movie|
    res &lt;&lt; movie.tweets.by_score[0]
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>OK. Now let&#8217;s imagine we create another action in the same controller,
one that needs only the first 5 elements:</p>

<p>Big controller style:</p>

<pre><code>def short_index_by_trending
  @premieretweets = Movie.with_tweet[0..5].inject([]) do |res,movie|
    res &lt;&lt; movie.tweets.by_score[0]
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Small controller style:</p>

<pre><code>def short_index_by_trending
  @premieretweets = Tweet.index_trending[0..5]
end
</code></pre>

<p>In the end, you are reusing and not repeating code with the &#8220;small
controller style&#8221; solution and well, it also looks much tidier.</p>

<p>Those are some of the reasons why I really appreciate initiatives like
inherit_resources, even if I don&#8217;t really use it so often (shame on me).</p>

    <link href="http://Gawyn.github.com/blog/blog/2012/01/29/why-do-i-love-method-missing/"/>
    <updated>2012-01-29T17:27:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://Gawyn.github.com/blog/blog/2012/01/29/why-do-i-love-method-missing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every Ruby developer has some tricks that he loves. Sometimes it&#8217;s not even necessary to use them a lot: it&#8217;s enough if you like them only in a philosophical or aesthetical way. When you talk about Ruby to a newcomer, the first thing you do is to give an enthusiastic description about that technique, your favourite one. And for me, I guess it&#8217;s <code>method_missing</code>.</p>

<h2>What is <code>method_missing</code>?</h2>

<p>I discovered method_missing in a great Ruby book: <em>Metaprogramming Ruby</em> by Paolo Perrotta. Originally, <em>method_missing</em> is a function that is only called when Ruby can&#8217;t find a given method into an object. If the object is the last in the jerarchy (in 1.9, BasicObject), <code>method_missing</code> raises an error; if not, it calls the same method in the inmediate superior object in the jerarchy.</p>

<h2>Oh, a method to raise an error. And why should I care?</h2>

<p>Because remember, in Ruby you can redefine methods as you like. With that feature, <code>method_missing</code> becomes the ultimate hook: you can intercept literally every action (that doesn&#8217;t have a method defined yet)) and treat it as you wish. For example, let&#8217;s make that everytime we call <code>write_{#something}</code>, Ruby writes it:</p>

<pre><code>def method_missing(method, *args)
  method_name = method.to_s
  if method_name.start_with?('write_')
    puts method_name[6..-1]
  else puts 'This method does not exist here'
  end
end
</code></pre>

<h2>That sounds like quite weird (and useless) stuff&#8230;</h2>

<p>Maybe, but it&#8217;s in the core of some of Ruby most popular gems, like (guess) Rails. Have your ever thought how some ActiveRecords methods like <code>find_by_#{attribute}</code> work? You are right, thanks to <code>method_missing</code>.</p>

<p>Actually, ActiveRecords combines <code>method_missing</code> with another great metaprogramming technique: dynamic methods. The first time you call a reader or writer method in an object of a given class, those methods are not still defined: then <code>method_missing</code> appears, defining the actions for each of the table columns. Clever, elegant and really, really useful.</p>

<h2>Whoa, now it sounds cool. Which are its flaws?</h2>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t sound cool, <strong>it is cool</strong>. But OK, it has some flaws. As with some other metaprogramming techniques, one is tempted to use them constantly, even when there isn&#8217;t any reason to use it over dynamic methods or even normal vanilla methods. And those are much better in terms of cost.</p>

<p>Another big flaw: it&#8217;s hard as hell to debug. In the end, we are &#8220;hacking&#8221; an error method, and one of the most basic ones.</p>

<h2>OK, now I see the pros and the cons. But why do you like it so much?</h2>

<p>As I told in the beginning, it&#8217;s a philosophical matter. <code>method_missing</code> ilustrates perfectly those famous words by Matz:</p>

<blockquote><p>Ruby trusts you. Ruby treats you as a grown-up programmer. It gives you great power such as meta-programming. But you need to remember that with great power comes great responsibility.</p></blockquote>

<p>To be able to wait in the backdoor for those treacherous method calls and giving them a good beating -I mean, dealing with them- it really changed my concept of software development. And I guess that is why I like <code>method_missing</code>. Exactly the same reason that makes me love Ruby.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Being at the same time an IT guy and a literature lover, I guess it&#8217;s normal I created a lot of blogs in my life: <a href="http://gawyn.blogspot.com/">El blog de Gawyn</a>, <a href="http://librosyfilms.wordpress.com/">Libros y Films</a>, and specially <a href="http://cafemarat.blogspot.com/">Café Marat</a> a blog with 73 (long) entries written in almost two years and that even after not being updated for more then three years, is still receiving almost 1.000 visits every month. I also created a cinema magazine, <a href="http://fundidoanegro.net">Fundido a Negro</a> that was also my first experience with Rails.</p>

<p>But, so far, this blogs were essencially about some of my other passions: literature and cinema. <strong>This blog will be different: it&#8217;s main topic will be my experiences with Ruby and other languages.</strong> Of course, I know that it&#8217;s always risky to predict the real content of something before creating it, but at least that is my purpose.</p>

<p>But why should a developer write about his job? First of all, to share the new lessons one takes everyday with other developers; right now, for any of us, it&#8217;s impossible to think about how it would be our coding without the help of the community via Google, blogs or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a>. But also because, quoting Einstein:</p>

<blockquote><p>If you can&#8217;t explain it simply, you don&#8217;t understand it well enough.</p></blockquote>

<p>And that&#8217;s enough for this entry. Let the real action begin!</p>
